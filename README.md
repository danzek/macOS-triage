# macOS triage

macOS triage is a python script to collect various macOS logs, artifacts, and other data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

There are a few basic dependencies for macOS triage. Ideally you would not want to install any additional programs on a target system. Eventually I will have a method to build a single executable which will be all that is needed for collection.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Triage

First, edit the list of triage_items in the Triage class to specify which categories are to be collected.

Next, edit the rsa_public_key in the Triage class if you plan on encrypting the output (it currently has my public key and I won't give you the private key.) See the Encrpytion Setup section for additional information.

To run the triage script, run the following:

    sudo python main.py

To run the triage script without encrypting the output, run the following:

    sudo python main.py --plaintext

The output will be a .tar.gz or .tar.gz.enc file depending on whether or not encryption was used.

## Encryption Setup

To make your own public/private key pair follow the example in a python console below:


    >>> from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
    >>> random_generator = Random.new().read
    >>> key = RSA.generate(2048, random_generator)
    >>> print key.exportKey()
    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    ...
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    # save this entire output to a file in a safe place for decryption later
    >>> print key.publickey().exportKey()
    -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
    ...
    -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
    # save this entire output to a file named 'id_rsa.pub' in the root of the script directory


## .enc Package Decryption

To decrypt an encrypted package, perform the following steps:

    python decryption/collection_package_decryptor.py -k <private key> -f <encrypted collection package>

## "Operation not permitted" Error in macOS Mojave

As of macOS 10.14 (Mojave), the Terminal app no longer has full disk access. In order to enable it, you must do the following:

- [ ] Open **System Preferences** from the Apple menu (ï£¿)
- [ ] Select **Security & Privacy**
- [ ] Select the **Privacy** tab
- [ ] Select **Full Disk Access** from the left pane
- [ ] Click the plus (+) button to add the Terminal app to the list of apps approved to access the full disk (you likely need to click the lock in the lower lefthand corner and authenticate with administrator privileges to unlock this functionality)
- [ ] Navigate to `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app` to add the Terminal app to the list of approved applications
- [ ] Relaunch the Terminal and you will now have full disk access

The good news is this should be sufficient for full disk access without having to [disable SIP](http://osxdaily.com/2015/10/05/disable-rootless-system-integrity-protection-mac-os-x/) as of macOS 10.4 (Mojave).

## TODO

* ability to package triage script into a single binary with all dependencies and config information
* integrate with https://github.com/wrmsr/pmem/tree/master/OSXPMem
